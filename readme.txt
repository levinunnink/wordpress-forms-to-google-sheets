The simple and secure way to connect Contact Form 7 to Notion.

== Description ==

Notion Monkey is the easiest and most secure way to connect any form to Notion and with this plugin it now works for Contact Form 7. As we looked at the options for connecting CF7 to Notion, they all seemed too complicated and risky, storing sensitive Notion Credentials in your WordPress database.

We built this to be:

- *Simple*: It shouldn't take multiple steps to send your form data to Notion. 
- *Secure*: By handling the connection in Notion Monkey's cloud and not on the WordPress host, you protect your Notion credentials from hackers and malicious plugins. 
- *No Adware:* The plugin shouldn't be constantly bugging you to upgrade.

To connect your form to Notion, you just need to configure a form in Notion Monkey and copy the  Notion Monkey form URL to your form config screen in WordPress.
