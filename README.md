# Sheet Monkey's Contact Form 7 to Google Sheets

The simple and secure way to connect Contact Form 7 to Google Sheets.

## Description

Sheet Monkey is the easiest and most secure way to connect any form to Google Sheets and with this plugin it now works for Contact Form 7. As we looked at the options for connecting CF7 to Google Sheets, they all seemed too complicated and risky, storing sensitive Google Credentials in your WordPress database.

We built this to be:

- *Simple*: It shouldn't take multiple steps to send your form data to Sheets. 
- *Secure*: By handling the connection in Sheet Monkey's cloud and not on the WordPress host, you protect your Google credentials from hackers and malicious plugins. 
- *No Adware:* The plugin shouldn't be constantly bugging you to upgrade.

To connect your form to Google Sheets, you just need to configure a form in Sheet Monkey and copy the  Sheet Monkey form URL to your form config screen in WordPress.
